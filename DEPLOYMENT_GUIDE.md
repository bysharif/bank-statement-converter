# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Bank Statement Converter Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

### 1. **CSV Format** - Separate Debit/Credit Columns
Your client requested separate columns for Debit and Credit instead of a combined Amount column.

**New CSV Format:**
```
Date,Description,Debit,Credit,Balance
2025-09-21,"Transfer to Pot",3.00,0.00,-999.85
2025-09-21,"Klarna*Klarna London GBR",12.00,0.00,-996.85
2025-09-21,"Sharif Kouthoofd (Faster Payments)",0.00,10.00,-984.85
```

### 2. **Real Data Parsing** - No More Dummy Data
The preview and CSV now show ACTUAL transactions from the uploaded PDF, not example data.

### 3. **Monzo Support** - Proper Date & Amount Handling
- Correctly parses DD/MM/YYYY format
- Identifies negative amounts as debits
- Identifies positive amounts as credits
- Extracts all transactions (not limited to 50)

---

## 📦 Files Changed:

All files are saved in `/Users/sharif/Projects/bank-statement-converter/`:

1. ✅ `src/lib/csv-utils.ts` - CSV format with Debit/Credit columns
2. ✅ `src/lib/monzo-parser.ts` - NEW specialized Monzo parser  
3. ✅ `src/app/api/send-csv/route.ts` - Deprecated dummy data endpoint
4. ✅ `src/app/api/parse-single-pdf/route.ts` - Enhanced with Monzo parser

## 🎬 DEPLOY NOW - 3 Steps:

### Step 1: Open Terminal
```bash
cd /Users/sharif/Projects/bank-statement-converter
```

### Step 2: Commit & Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Fix: Real transaction parsing with separate Debit/Credit columns

- CSV now has separate Debit and Credit columns (not combined Amount)
- Added specialized Monzo parser for DD/MM/YYYY format  
- Removed mock/dummy data generation
- Parse ALL transactions from PDF (unlimited)

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Wait for Auto-Deploy
Vercel will automatically deploy in **~2-3 minutes**

**Live URL:** https://www.convertbank-statement.com/

---

## ✅ Testing After Deployment:

### Test 1: Upload the Monzo PDF
1. Go to https://www.convertbank-statement.com/convert
2. Upload the Monzo statement PDF (Natasha's statement)
3. **Expected:** Processing completes successfully

### Test 2: Check Preview
**Expected Preview (First 3 transactions):**
- ✅ Transfer to Pot | Debit: £3.00
- ✅ Klarna*Klarna London | Debit: £12.00  
- ✅ Sharif Kouthoofd | Credit: £10.00

**Transaction Count:** ~150+ transactions (not 50, not dummy data)

### Test 3: Download & Open CSV
1. Click "Download CSV" button
2. Open in Excel or Google Sheets
3. **Expected Columns:** Date, Description, Debit, Credit, Balance
4. **Check Row 1:** Transfer to Pot shows 3.00 in Debit, 0.00 in Credit
5. **Check Row 3:** Sharif payment shows 0.00 in Debit, 10.00 in Credit

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong:

### Preview Still Shows Dummy Data?
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
```

### CSV Format Still Wrong?
1. Check Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/bysharif/bank-statement-converter
2. Verify deployment succeeded
3. Check deployment logs for errors

### Transaction Count Wrong?
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for parsing errors
3. Check if Monzo parser was used (should see "🏦 Detected Monzo statement" in logs)

---

## 🧪 Optional: Test Locally First

If you want to test before deploying:

```bash
cd /Users/sharif/Projects/bank-statement-converter

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser
# http://localhost:3000/convert
```

Then upload the Monzo PDF and test.
