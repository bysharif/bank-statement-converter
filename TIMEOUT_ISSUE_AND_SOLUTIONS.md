# PDF Processing Timeout Issue

## Problem Identified ✅

Your bank statement PDF (655KB, ~10-20 pages) is taking **longer than 60 seconds** for Claude AI to process, causing Vercel to timeout:

```
Vercel Runtime Timeout Error: Task timed out after 60 seconds
```

## Why This Happens

1. **PDF Size:** 655KB with many pages and transactions
2. **AI Processing:** Claude reads every page, extracts data, formats CSV
3. **Vercel Limits:**
   - Free/Hobby tier: 10 seconds max
   - Pro tier: 60 seconds default (configurable up to 300s)
   - Your current limit: 60 seconds

## Solutions

### Option 1: Test with Smaller PDF (Quickest) ⚡
**Try this first!**

Upload a **1-3 page statement** (<200KB) to verify the parser works. This will confirm:
- ✅ Claude integration working
- ✅ CSV extraction working
- ✅ All code logic working
- ✅ Only timeout is the issue

### Option 2: Upgrade Vercel Plan ($20/month) 💰

Upgrade to **Vercel Pro** to increase timeout:
1. Go to vercel.com → Settings → Billing
2. Upgrade to Pro plan ($20/month)
3. I'll update `maxDuration` to 300 seconds
4. Can handle PDFs up to 50+ pages

### Option 3: Implement Chunking (Free, Complex) 🔧

I can implement a system that:
1. Splits large PDFs into smaller chunks (2-3 pages each)
2. Processes each chunk separately
3. Combines results into one CSV
4. Takes 2-3 hours to implement properly

### Option 4: Use Alternative Service (Different Architecture) 🏗️

Switch from serverless to:
- Long-running server (Railway, Render, etc.)
- Background job queue (BullMQ + Redis)
- More complex but no timeout limits

## What I've Done

✅ **Optimizations applied:**
- Reduced token limit (4096 → 2048) for faster processing
- Using fastest Claude model (Haiku)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Auto-header detection for Claude responses

✅ **Code fixes deployed:**
- CSV header handling
- Timeout protection on frontend
- Better error messages

## Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate (Today):**
1. Test with a **small 1-3 page PDF** to verify everything works
2. If successful, you know it's just a timeout issue

**Short-term (This Week):**
- **For Production:** Upgrade to Vercel Pro ($20/month)
- **For Testing:** Continue using small PDFs

**Long-term (If needed):**
- Implement chunking for very large statements (20+ pages)
- Or move to long-running server architecture

## Test Files

Do you have any of these to test with?
- Single month statement (1-3 pages)
- Weekly statement
- Screenshot of transactions (smaller file)

This will prove the system works and it's just the timeout limit.

## Cost Analysis

**Current Setup:**
- Vercel Free: $0/month (10s timeout) ❌ Not working
- Or Vercel Pro: $20/month (300s timeout) ✅ Would work

**Per-request Costs:**
- Claude API: ~$0.003 per statement
- Vercel bandwidth: Negligible

**For your use case:**
- Estimate: 100 conversions/month
- Claude cost: $0.30/month
- Vercel Pro: $20/month
- **Total: ~$20.30/month**

## Questions?

1. **Do you have a smaller PDF to test with?**
2. **What's your budget for this service?**
3. **How many large statements will you process per month?**

Let me know which option you'd like to pursue!
