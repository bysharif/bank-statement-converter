It's quick, straight-forward, and now my downloaded QB statements aren't so frightening. Thank you SO much, Steve!\n\nCliff Paulick\n\nCliff, only horror movies and skydiving should be frightening, not QuickBooks. —Steve\n\n### A Tailor-made Charmer\n\nMany thanks to the Quickbooks community to have mentioned Steve Rumberg's converter. It works like a charm. I sent Steve the format of my bank statements, and he tailor-made a converter for me. I later needed to make a minor change and Steve was kind enough to make the change for me without charging more. Awesome customer service! Steve's converter is truly a gem — very easy to use, and very affordable! Thank you, Steve.\n\nthanks and regards, Quyen\n\nQuyen, I'm glad to be of help and I enjoyed working with you. —Steve\n\n### Pleasantly Surprised\n\nSteve, I don't often find people or companies who are service focused, but you have clearly demonstrated your commitment to quality, as stated on your website. I was pleasantly surprised that when I had questions about your program, you responded to my email within minutes, and immediately responded to each of my responses. Thank you for setting such a high quality standard. I would not hesitate to purchase another of your solutions.\n\nHeather, Greenman Construction\n\nThank you for the kind words, Heather, I'm happy to surprise you :-) —Steve\n\n### Working Great\n\nI just tried it, Steve, and everything looks to be working great. Thank you VERY much for your help, and if you need anyone to write a good review for your product, I'd be happy to do so. Many thanks!\n\nDusty\n\nYou are quite welcome. I'll let you know if I need a good review. Oh, wait — there it is, just above! —Steve\n\n### Highly Recommend\n\nThe converter works great and is exactly what I wanted. The download and installment instructions were step by step and easy to understand. The program saves me a lot of time. I am able to manipulate the data in excel and upload it to Quickbooks within in minutes. Fast and easy and accurate! I highly recommend this converter to anyone who is looking to save time. Thank you Steve for have this program available.\n\nThanks again,\n\nIlona\n\nSounds like Statement Converter hit the mark. Thanks for the feedback, Ilona! —Steve\n\n### Awesome Customer Service!\n\nA huge THANK YOU for your dedication and awesome service. Both the Bank Statement converter (bought 2 months ago) and the Credit Card Statement Converter (bought yesterday) work like a charm — as if there is a magic wand. I am particular grateful for the care that you showed in addressing my needs and keeping the cost down for me (even if it means you get paid less). You go about serving customers with the utmost integrity, and you have won my trust completely. Thanks a million.\n\nQuyen\n\nMy dad is an amateur magician, so I borrowed his magic wand and included some \"abracadabra\" in the program. Glad you noticed :-)\n\n### Grace, Speed and Efficiency\n\nIt is not often, in this day & age, to find such dedicated customer service. Steve has customised the importation of my Bank & Credit Card statements into Quickbooks with grace, speed & efficiency. I commend this service to anyone wishing to streamline their accounting systems.\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\nDip Arch(Hons) RIBA, MIA, Pr. Arch, CIA, Pr. CPM\n\nAndrew, it was a pleasure working with you. Next, I'm developing a program to convert professional designations into plain English :-)\n\n### More than worth it\n\nIt works with my QuickBooks Pro 2003! Thank you very much for the converter. You saved me a lot of typing and potential errors and have already more than earned the nominal fee you charged. Thanks again.\n\nSteven Judelson, Amagansett Sea Salt Co.\n\nFantastic! —Steve\n\n### Easier than QuickBooks' own credit card import\n\nI was hesitant at first because seemed like it would be a lot of work, but its amazing actually how much easier it is after you get it setup than the native credit card transaction import of Quickbooks 2008, which Intuit stopped supporting. That situation left me with either having to upgrade to latest or finding another solution. Didn't like those tactics of Intuit so I found the other solution here and it works very well. Thanks again for your help.\n\nRichard A.\n\nThat’s a good point: easier and no need to upgrade. It’s nice when that happens. —Steve\n\n### Making life easier\n\nThe Home Depot Converter has made my accounting so much easier! When I first downloaded the program, I had a little trouble getting it to work on my computer; most likely due to the fact that my computer is so old. Steve helped me get the program to work seamlessly. Thanks!\n\nLauren K.\n\nStatement Converter and I are glad to be of help! —Steve\n\n### Rejoicing over it!\n\nProcrastinators rejoice! With the end of another tax year approaching, Statement Converter will let you burn through the past year’s worth of credit card and bank statement in record time. I wish I had looked for a tool like this year’s ago.\n\nSteve answered every question I asked within hours, and some within minutes of my emailing him. I was able to have Statement Converter up and running and go through several month’s worth of statements in a single evening. Using this tool going forward will save me hours of drudgery.\n\nAli L.\n\nThe holidays, family and now Statement Converter -- all reasons to rejoice! Thanks, Ali :-) —Steve\n\n### Exactly as promised\n\nThanks so much for your help and great product!! The program works exactly like you said it would. I am savings hours of time.\n\nThanks again,\n\nTim Warner\n\nPresident\n\nWarner Insurance Agency\n\nThat’s what I love to hear. You’re welcome! —Steve\n\n### Best Result at the Lowest Cost\n\nThree months ago, I encountered a situation where I had to import Excel / CVS files for an oil company. After spending over $2,500 on Quickbooks Enterprise, Intuit could not help me with importing any of the historical Excel / CVS data. We purchased a $99.00 3rd party conversion tool, which was a massive headache and the company provided no support, not to mention it only imported 70% of the transactions, the rest having to be entered manually. Steve Rumberg, from Statement Converter, provided a custom solution which worked for 100% of the transactions. I just wish I'd found Statement Converter earlier!\n\nFrank Anthony (Military \\| Civilian \\| Corporate Tech Consultant)\n\n100% success and the lowest cost. Is this a \"no brainer\" or what? —Steve\n\n### Worked Great\n\nSteve,\n\nI used this to enter my CC splits. Worked great. Instructions are easy to follow.\n\nHappy New Year, Mark\n\nWell, I don’t recommend that men do the splits, but I’m glad that Statement Converter worked well for you. Happy New Year! —Steve\n\n### Thrilled!\n\nI can't tell you how THRILLED I am to have found Steve Rumberg and his Statement Converter. I have been trying to convert csv files to iif for YEARS and could not get any of the other programs or processes to work for me. Steve is nothing short of brilliant. He is completely committed to making his program work for everyone that wants it, and he goes above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that happens. I had heard he provided great customer service, but this was nothing short of amazing. He's brilliant. I highly recommend both Steve and his Statement Converter! Thank you Steve!\n\nKate D., sleepygoat farm and cheese\n\nThank you, Kate — you were nice to work with. Now, if I could just get my wife to say these things about me... :-) —Steve\n\n### Great Product\n\nHi Steve,\n\nI just wanted to thank you so much for your great product. I love the VENDOR file where I can enter abbreviations and automatically classify the vendor to the proper account.\n\nGreat job !!!!\n\nStewart Oberman, KIS Computing\n\nHey, Stew, that’s nice hear. I appreciate the feedback! —Steve\n\n### Highly Recommend\n\nI recently began using Quickbooks and found that the credit card used by my company does not download to Quickbooks as most do. I didn't know what to do because I certainly did not want to manually enter all of the transactions.\n\nI looked on the internet and found the converter by Steve Rumberg. I purchased it for a very nominal fee. Steve’s instructions on the internet are very easy to understand and when I had other questions Steve was very quick to email me with easy to understand explanations.\n\nI would highly recommend this converter for Quickbooks.\n\nKaren Bojak\n\nThank you for the nice feedback, Karen. —Steve\n\n### Amazing Life Saver\n\nThis utility is amazing and if you don't see your banking institution listed, just ask the developer for a custom converter. What a life saver and I no longer need to spend hours entering transactions!!\n\nPlease save yourself the trouble of searching the internet for free utilities because this one just works for Windows and Mac!!!!\n\nThanks again Steve.\n\nGabrielle C.\n\nSaving lives is a recently added feature -- I’m glad it’s working! —Steve\n\n### Another life saved\n\nHaving your software to import ALL the transactions was a lifesaver.\n\nEli T., Director/Editor\n\nNow that’s two lives saved. Folks, please don’t call me a hero, I’m just trying to help. —Steve\n\n### Happiness is…\n\nYea! I converted January’s statement and posted it. Wow, I am so very happy. Thank you again.\n\nCheryl H.\n\nI’m happy that you’re happy. You’re welcome! —Steve\n\n### Unreasonably Good\n\nWhen I needed a statement converter, I searched google and found this site. It was a leap of faith at the time because it’s hard to differentiate one converter from the next. Now that I have purchased this one, I am so glad I did because I learned what the difference is: service.\n\nMy statements were from a unique type of account and, initially, the converter did not recognize it. After emailing, Steve was amazingly helpful. On several occasions Steve was kind enough to remotely work on installing and adjusting the program to suit my needs and ultimately custom built me a version to meet my needs. He went well-beyond any reasonable expectations for customer service and really saved the day for me.\n\nI can’t recommend this product and service enough.\n\nDavid Feinberg\n\nUnreasonably good customer service: why is that unusual these days? —Steve\n\n### Fantastic Tool\n\nFantastic Tool! This converter worked wonderfully to convert all my historical data (1000’s of transactions) from a web-hosted accounting service into Quickbooks transactions. It was so worth the purchase! It saved me so much time. I recommend it to anyone that needs to convert data to a Quickbooks format. Thank you very much!\n\nKayla\n\nExcellent! —Steve\n\n### Did the Job Beautifully\n\nGreat application! I purchased this package to import banking transaction data into Quickbooks Pro 2000 and found that it did the job beautifully. I had some small setup problems due to my conversion file format, but Steve solved my problems within a few minutes and I was able to import 400+ transactions in no time at all... Thanks to Steve for both the application and the great support!\n\nMark Clark\n\nBeautiful things can come in small packages :-) Steve\n\n### The Answer\n\nSteve, your statement converter is THE ANSWER I've been looking for!! I just knew there had to be a fast,\neasy way to keep up with my Quickbooks, and your converter is IT! I can now do in a few MINUTES what once\ntook me HOURS to do. I also must say that I have never experienced better customer service in my life! I\nhighly recommend you and your product to ANYONE who wants to make their life easier by spending LESS time\ndoing grunt work and MORE time doing things they truly love and enjoy. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\nAmber Shannon\n\nYou are welcome, welcome, welcome! And, thank you for your second order! — Steve\n\n### Absolute Love\n\nMy company recently signed up for an American Express Corporate card that only offers PDFs and Excel\nspreadsheet statement downloads and we needed an efficient and easy way to enter all of our many charges\ninto QuickBooks rather than wasting time manually entering each charge ourselves.\n\nSteve helped me over the span of a week to customize the converter to our particular statement, and it\nworks perfectly. Absolutely love this converter and truly appreciate the quick response time and help from\nSteve to make sure it would work for our needs!\n\nKerri Foster\n\nAin't love grand?! — Steve\n\n### Saved TONS of Time\n\nSteve,\n\nCredit Card Converter worked great.\n\nSaving me TONS of time - thanks very much.\n\nJust purchased the Chase Bank Acct Converter as well.\n\nThank you again\n\nEd Plamondon\n\nSounds like a great WEIGHT off your shoulders :-) Steve\n\n### Taxes Done on Time\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for spending the time to help me transfer the file into my Quickbooks. Everything\ntransferred nicely. Your customer service and professionalism surpassed anything I could have hoped for. Now\nI can get my taxes done on time :)\n\nMubarakah Ibrahim\n\nI'm glad to make tax time less taxing! — Steve\n\n### I Shouldn’t Tell You This But...\n\nSteve, I've been meaning to take a moment to thank you for providing an excellent product. We really needed\nexactly what only you provide, I'm very grateful to you for the ease of use, the extensive online instructions,\nand your prompt follow-up and customization. I probably shouldn't tell you - but you could be charging so much\nmore! Anyway, thanks again.\n\nAll best,\n\nRachel Allen\n\nYou're welcome. I lose money on every sale, but I make it up on volume :-) Steve\n\n### Speechless!\n\nI'm speechless! I greatly appreciate all your help and dedication! I was ready to call it quits because\nsomething wasn't working right, but I was so impressed with the excellent customer service you provided\nto fix the files that somehow had gotten corrupted. Thank you so much, Steve! You are a hero. You've saved\nme from months of data entry! Cannot wait to send my friends over! :)\n\nLiz G., Lizbeth Geary Photography\n\n>\\> I'm looking forward to meeting your friends, I just hope they call first! — Steve\n\n\n### Ahh, Symbiosis\n\nSteve, thank you so much for taking the time and energy to make sure I felt 100% confident in what I was doing.\nIt's rare to find someone truly dedicated to their customers and the quality of their products. Not only did\nyou ensure a symbiotic relationship between the converter and Quickbooks, you also saved me hours and hours\nof manually importing data.\n\nYou are one of a kind. Thank you!\n\nValerie Steighner\n\nI see your data and QuickBooks holding hands, walking the beach as the sun sets... ahh, symbiosis!\n\n### You're for real!\n\nSteve, I needed an easy way to import statements from Merrill Lynch into Quickbooks, but Merrill Lynch\ndoes not provide the functionality on their website. I Googled for solutions and found your site. So often\nit seems as if there are no real people behind internet commerce, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that\nsomeone is indeed there! You were fast and responsive and even customized a solution for me. I highly\nrecommend your converters and services to anyone who is looking for an easy way to get data into Quickbooks.\n\nElizabeth Waldorf, Accounting\n\nMonte Zucker Photographic Education\n\nI am a real person. I am not a robot. I am not a robot. I am not a ....\n\n### Saved from Horribleness\n\nHi Steve, thanks for the awesome customer service and excellent product! You've saved me hundreds of\nhorrible hours at my desk!\n\nBest,\n\nMark Berenblum\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nWalrus Kayaks\n\n\nSo, that leaves just the good hours at your desk :-)\n\n### Love It!\n\nJust imported a couple hundred transactions....LOVE IT!!\n\nThanks for all your help, and your instructions online are great. I’ve implemented a\nbunch of the optional settings and it’s going to make life a lot easier!\n\n-Lee\n\nI love to hear it. Thanks for the feedback! — Steve\n\n### Invaluable Tool\n\nSteve wrote a custom converter which has enabled me to quickly import my credit card transactions into Quickbooks.\nIt is an invaluable tool that has automated one of the most tedious, and thereby most often neglected, aspects of\nmy data entry. Steve followed up quickly with tweaks needed specifically for my application, and I highly\nrecommend his work to anyone in need of such a product.\n\nDr. Roland D. Dowdy, III,\n\nVice President,\n\nCamp Holly Springs, Inc.\n\nInvalid = not valid but Invaluable = extremely valuable. I taught\nin Japan and Switzerland for four years and had to explain this. I think they are still scratching their\nheads over it! — Steve\n\n### Touchdown!\n\nSteve,\n\nBoth your customer service and your program are a complete touchdown! Thanks so much for saving us so much\ntime on these conversions as entering this much data manually would take far more time. Also, I appreciate\nyour help with the custom \"tweaking\" of the program to fit our needs. The price you charged to do that was\nVERY reasonable and it much appreciated!\n\nThanks again!\n\nDustin Webster\n\nStatement Converter is at the 30, the 20, the 10... he scores! Statement Converter saves the day!\nThe crowd goes wild!\n\n### Works for Blondes\n\nSteve's Statement Converter has taken me away from hours of data entry in front of a computer screen sitting in my office\nchair to hours of R&R beside my pool in my chaise lounge!!! His heart must be in helping others\nbecause I don't believe he's charging enough!!! He's went out of his way to help me and even\ngot \"Blonde-rooted\" me up and running in no time!!! :)\n\nLisa L.\n\nLisa added that her husband tells her, \"You ain't the britest crayon in the box, but you're\ndefinately the purdiest\" (I really cannot add any comment to this; when you’re married, you learn when to keep quiet!)\n\n### Back in Control\n\nThe \"Statement Converter\" program has made transferring my credit card transactions into\nQuickBooks possible. Any questions I had to get the program working were answered timely and patiently by Steve.\nIt has helped me to get control over my expenses and save me time. This is really important to me as a small\nbusiness owner.\nThanks!\n\nKaren S.\n\nMy program works for all business owners, regardless of height. — Steve\n\n### The Conquerer\n\nThe converter is very simple to use and provides a reasonable alternative to the expensive monthly fees charged by the banks.\nIt also provides a great way to be able to import other bank info into QB. I received the program by email right away and was\nusing it within a very short period. The installation and use information is excellent, it is laid out in a very intuitive\n\"use what you need\" format that flows very well. I highly recommend this product.\n\nNow if I could only conquer QB...\n\nMark Elliott\n\nQuickBooks users unite! We shall conquer QB or die trying! — Steve\n\n### Whoah! Just Saved $680!\n\nMy accountant said he would import my data into quickbooks at $175 per hour and he would cap it at 4 hours.\nWhoah! Then I found Statement Converter for $20. Yes, it takes time to acclimate yourself to the product but\nfirst and foremost Steve’s help and FAQ is very well written. I tested many times without problems\nbut QuickBooks did complain about a few lines. All-in-all, I spent about one hour solving issues and was\nso pleased to watch 876 transactions get imported into Quickbooks with memos. Yes, I tipped Steve via Paypal!\n\nDarrell Catmull, Destiny Real Estate\n\nWhoah! That's a nice savings, cowboy! — Steve\n\n### Best Tutorial Ever\n\nI worked in software for a baker’s dozen years before moving to Publishing\n(and I still do some consulting.) Your tutorial is the best and most comprehensive I have ever encountered.\nI just worked my way up through the \"small sample set of data\" test and everything went very smoothly.\nIn fact, I have to say that this is the FIRST thing since I started trying to set my books up in Quickbooks that\nhas gone more easily than expected. (Though I shouldn’t discount finding a parking spot directly in front\nof my accountant’s office in Seattle.)\n\nShasta Willson, Author/Publisher\n\nI knew someone would eventually appreciate the effort. Thanks! — Steve\n\n### Slickest Thing Since Sliced Bread\n\nThe Statement Converter is the slickest thing since sliced bread. I was somewhat confused as I wanted to\nhave my statements organized prior to importing into QuickBooks. I opted for the \"Quick Start\" phone assistance from Steve.\nWe scheduled a time and he patiently spent well over an hour to get it perfect. Steve wouldn't let me off of the\nphone until it worked perfect. He even showed me a few tricks in QuickBooks. Money well spent. I would highly\nrecommend this service.\n\nJeff Kermath, Saline MI\n\nDarn you, Sliced Bread — you've taken top ranking from me! — Steve\n\n### Impressed and Happy\n\nI had purchased the Home Depot Statement converter and I was pretty satisfied with the program, but I wanted\nto capture more information, specifically the \"Store Location/Description.\" I asked if there was a\nway to do this and was told that my current version did not support it, but that they would update the converter to do\nthis, and they did it in 2 days. WOW, now I am impressed and very happy with the product. Way to go, and thanks.\n\nOh, and our annual convention is coming up the end of the month and I will pass this on to other owners.\n\nGlenn Garvey, Handyman Matters\n\nI'm happy that you're impressed. You're welcome! — Steve\n\n### Better Than Direct Import\n\nJust wanted to say thanks for the program. I set the config file to my needs and it works great. I\nactually prefer to use this method as opposed to importing in directly from the bank.\n\n\nI like to code, too, and it's not too often that someone appreciates all the hard work and late hours on the keyboard. Thanks again.\n\n\nJim Minock\n\nMaybe Intuit will replace QuickBooks' \"Online Banking\" function with \"Statement Converter\" :-) — Steve\n\n### No \"Ugh!\"\n\nThanks for the follow-up. I’ve already installed it, run some conversions, and pulled them into QB, so everything is good.\n\nThanks for making this available, otherwise I was going to be up for a long bout in Excel figuring out how to generate IIF files. Ugh!\n\nDavid Roach\n\nWelcome to the no \"ugh\" method — Steve\n\n### Way Cool\n\nThanks for the help – and for being a conversion nut that wants to help other people who really hate to type in data.\nI had been paying a bookkeeper to do manual data entry and now I can do this myself, which is way cool...\n\nRuth Miller\n\nSee folks, accounting can be cool, too!\n\n### What Can Be Better?\n\nAs a user who deals with quickbooks and some clients who do not wish to do direct download, I use converters rather than spend\ntime entering every transaction. The ones I have used have been clumsy and required tweaking every time. Not Steve’s converter! His worked\nperfectly with the bank I was working with. And, when that bank changed the format of their csv files, I contacted Steve and he sent me the\nupdated version at no charge! What can be better than that?! Will definitely be buying more of Steve’s converters in the future!!\n\nEdie Foss, Reliable Accounting and Tax Service\n\nThank you for notifying me of the change in the CSV file; I was happy to update the program for you.\n\n### A Happy Accident\n\nIt was a \"happy accident\" when I stumbled upon the Statement Converter website!\nI had been searching online for a way to import my bank statements into QuickBooks without having to buy an expensive upgrade every 3 years.\nThe cost was minuscule compared to QB. However, the best part is Steve, the genius behind the product. His customer support is the BEST and quickest anywhere! On 2 different\noccasions since I bought Statement Converter my bank changed some of the data fields in the csv file which caused the converter not to work properly. Of course, this was not\nSteve’s fault but he helped me get it fixed quickly and easily. I just wish some of the other companies that I do business with had someone like Steve there…but of\ncourse he’s an extremely \"rare breed\" these days.\n\nConnie H.\n\nI’m glad we found your happy place :-) Good customer service is no accident.\n\n### Taking the time to be Quick\n\nThank you, Steve, for taking the time to sort out the Statement Converter and customize it for my specific conversion. Your quick reaction time and the time that you took to make it work for me is much appreciated.\n\nNorman Stevens\n\nAs a data-conversion ninja, speed is important so I'm always honing my reaction time :-)\n\n### Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!\n\nDear Steve,\n\nThank you so much for all of your incredible help, wonderful customer service, and exceptional expertise!!\n\nI love managing my clients’ multi-million dollar accounts, but spent way too much time entering endless transactions for them each month. Now with the simple click of a few buttons, and literally 2 minutes, all transactions are downloaded automatically and perfectly, and I am free to work on much higher-level tasks!!\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you!!\n\nTake good care,\n\nMary Kent\n\nYou are welcome, welcome, welcome!! :-)\n\n### Beyond Satisfied!\n\nThanks for a lifesaver! Your customer service is superb. Steve custom made one of the converters that I needed.\n\nI use converters for three different banks and they work better and faster than QB Bank\nFeeds. After you spend the initial time of setting up your vendors, it\nis a breeze and zero errors!!\n\nI am beyond satisfied. Thanks a lot Steve!\n\nAna Kairis, CPA\n\nExcellent. I'm beyond happy to hear that :-)\n\n### OMG!!\n\nOMG!!....Thank you so much for putting this application together. I am using it along with the Lookup Feature for our vendors and it\nhas already saved us days worth of work. It works perfectly.\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nMichael R. Tills, Owner/Senior Systems Engineer, Competitive Edge Technology Group, Inc.\n\nYou are most welcome. Time-saving perfection is my goal!\n\nStatement Converter imports from most bank accounts, credit cards, and software.\n\nIf your vendor is not listed, send your file and I’ll add it.\n\n![](https://statementconverter.com/assets/logos/1st_source_bank.ico)1st Source Bank CSV/Excel bank account statement to
