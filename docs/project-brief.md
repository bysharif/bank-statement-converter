# Project Brief: Bank Statement Converter

## What (Project Description)

The Bank Statement Converter is a comprehensive tool designed to parse, convert, and standardize bank statements across multiple formats and financial institutions. The application will support:

- **Input Formats**: PDF, CSV, Excel (XLS/XLSX), OFX, QIF, and proprietary bank formats
- **Output Formats**: CSV, Excel, JSON, QIF, OFX, and custom formats for accounting software
- **Processing Modes**: Web interface, CLI tool, and API endpoints
- **Core Features**:
  - Multi-bank support with custom parsers
  - Intelligent transaction categorization
  - Duplicate detection and handling
  - Data validation and error reporting
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Secure local and cloud processing options

## Why (Problem Being Solved)

### Primary Problems:
1. **Format Incompatibility**: Different banks export statements in various formats that aren't compatible with accounting software
2. **Manual Data Entry**: Users spend hours manually entering transaction data into accounting systems
3. **Error-Prone Process**: Manual transcription leads to errors and inconsistencies
4. **Time Consumption**: Converting multiple statements is a repetitive, time-consuming task
5. **Limited Tools**: Existing tools are often expensive, limited in scope, or lack security features

### Market Opportunity:
- Small businesses and freelancers need affordable financial tools
- Accountants and bookkeepers require efficient data processing solutions
- Personal finance enthusiasts want better transaction management
- Growing demand for financial automation tools
