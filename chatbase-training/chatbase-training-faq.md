## TROUBLESHOOTING QUESTIONS

### Why won't my file upload?
Common causes:
1. **File too large** - Check plan limits (10MB free, 50MB starter, 100MB pro)
2. **Wrong format** - We accept PDF, CSV, Excel, JPG, PNG only
3. **Corrupted file** - Try re-downloading from your bank
4. **Browser issue** - Try different browser or incognito mode
5. **Slow internet** - Large files need stable connection

Try: Clear browser cache, use Chrome/Firefox, check file isn't password-protected.

### Why is accuracy low for my statement?
Possible reasons:
1. **Unusual bank format** - Contact us, we'll add support
2. **Poor scan quality** - Try rescanning at higher resolution
3. **Handwritten entries** - OCR can't read handwriting
4. **Very old statement** - Banks change formats over time
5. **Foreign language** - We currently support English only

**Solution**: Email the statement to support@convertbank-statement.com - we'll manually improve it for free and add the format to our system.

### Transactions are missing - why?
Check these:
1. **Multi-page PDF** - Ensure all pages uploaded
2. **Summary only** - Some PDFs show summaries not transactions
3. **Date range** - We extract dates shown on statement
4. **Hidden entries** - Some banks hide small transactions
5. **Plan limits** - Free plan has 100 transaction limit

**Fix**: Try re-uploading, check original has all transactions, or upgrade plan.

### Why are duplicates showing?
This can happen when:
1. **Statement overlaps** - Multiple statements covering same dates
2. **Pending transactions** - Show twice (pending and cleared)
3. **Bank errors** - Actual duplicates in source statement

**Solution**: Professional+ plans include duplicate detection and removal. Free/Starter users can manually delete in Excel/CSV.

### Categories are wrong - can I fix them?
AI categorization (Professional+ only) is 90% accurate but not perfect. You can:
1. **Edit in exported file** - Manually correct categories
2. **Custom rules** - Set up in your account settings
3. **Feedback** - Mark wrong categories to improve AI
4. **Disable auto-categorization** - Get uncategorized exports

Categories include: Groceries, Transport, Bills, Shopping, Income, etc.

### Export won't open in my software - help!
Try these:
1. **Excel issues**: Use Excel format (.xlsx) not CSV
2. **QuickBooks**: Ensure using correct format (QBO for Online, QIF for Desktop)
3. **Character encoding**: Try UTF-8 if special characters broken
4. **Date format**: Change in account settings (DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY)
5. **Decimal separator**: UK uses . others use ,

Contact support with error message - we'll fix it fast!

### Processing is taking forever - what's wrong?
Normal times are 15-60 seconds. If longer:
1. **Very large file** - 2,000+ transactions can take 90 seconds
2. **Poor quality scan** - OCR takes longer on blurry images
3. **Server load** - Rare peak times (usually midnight UK time)
4. **Internet issues** - Check your connection

If over 2 minutes, refresh and try again. Still stuck? Contact support.

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "This seems too expensive"
I understand budget concerns! Let's look at the value:

**Time savings**: If you spend even 1 hour per month on manual data entry, at £20/hour that's £20 saved. Our Starter plan costs £9.99 - you save £10+ each month!

**Accuracy value**: Accounting errors can cost hundreds in tax penalties or lost deductions. Our 99.6% accuracy prevents costly mistakes.

**Free alternative**: Try our Free plan - 3 conversions/month forever, no commitment. Many users find this sufficient!

**Money-back guarantee**: Try any paid plan risk-free for 14 days. Not happy? Full refund, no questions asked.

### "I can do this manually"
You absolutely can! But consider:
- **Time**: Manual entry takes 30-90 minutes per statement. We do it in 30 seconds.
- **Errors**: Human error rate is 3-5% (30-50 errors per 1,000 transactions). Ours is 0.4%.
- **Tedium**: Manual entry is boring and exhausting. Let AI handle it while you focus on higher-value work.
- **Scalability**: One statement is manageable. Multiple accounts or clients? Manual becomes impossible.

**Try the Free plan** - experience the difference yourself!

### "I'll just use free OCR tools"
Free OCR tools are great for text, but they:
- Don't understand bank statement structure
- Can't categorize transactions
- Don't format for accounting software
- Require extensive manual cleanup
- Usually have 80-85% accuracy vs our 99.6%

Users report spending 2-3 hours cleaning up free OCR output. Our service is done in 30 seconds, ready to import.

### "What if you go out of business?"
Fair concern! Here's our stability:
- **Profitable** - We're self-funded and profitable since year 1
- **Growing** - 200% year-over-year growth
- **Backed** - Supported by Innovate UK grant
- **Committed** - Long-term vision, not a quick flip
- **Data protection** - You can export all your data anytime

Plus 14-day money-back guarantee means zero risk to try us!

### "I don't trust uploading sensitive financial data"
Completely understandable! Security concerns are valid. Here's why you can trust us:

- **Same encryption as banks** - 256-bit AES
- **UK servers** - Your data never leaves the UK
- **GDPR certified** - Independently verified compliance
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Bank-grade security standards
- **Automatic deletion** - Free plan deletes files immediately
- **No staff access** - Zero-knowledge encryption means we can't read your data
- **£5M insurance** - Cyber liability coverage
- **No breach history** - Perfect security record since launch

**Most importantly**: We never ask for bank login credentials. You upload statement files only - the same files you'd email to your accountant.

### "My accountant can do this"
They can! But:
- **Accountants cost £40-80/hour** - Our entire month costs less than 30 minutes of their time
- **Better use of their expertise** - Let them focus on tax strategy, not data entry
- **Faster service** - We're instant, accountants may take days
- **You stay in control** - Get your data anytime, no waiting

Many accountants actually **recommend us** to their clients to save everyone time and money!
